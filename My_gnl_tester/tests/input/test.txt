South Africa is a country on the southernmost tip of the 
African continent, marked by several distinct ecosystems. 
Inland safari destination Kruger National Park is populated by 
big game. The Western Cape offers beaches, lush winelands around 
Stellenbosch and Paarl, craggy cliffs at the Cape of Good Hope, forest 
and lagoons along the Garden Route, and the 
city of Cape Town, beneath flat-topped Table Mountain.
