Angola is a Southern African nation whose
varied terrain encompasses tropical Atlantic beaches, a labyrinthine system of rivers and Sub-Saharan desert 
that extends across the border into Namibia. The country's colonial history is reflected in its Portuguese-influenced 
cuisine and its landmarks including Fortaleza de SÃ£o Miguel, 
a fortress built by the Portuguese in 1576 to
defend the capital, Luanda.
